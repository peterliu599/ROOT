\title{Generate covariates \code{X} and potential outcomes (\code{Y0}, \code{Y1})}
\usage{
gen_XY(n = 1000, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer or numeric. Number of observations to simulate (must be positive).}

\item{seed}{Optional. Single numeric value for RNG seed. If provided, a global
seed is set for reproducibility. If \code{NULL} (default), no seed is set (results
will vary on each run).}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\item{X}{A data frame of simulated covariates with columns \verb{X0, X1, ...} up to \code{X(p-1)}.}
\item{Y}{A data frame of potential outcomes with columns \code{Y0} (baseline outcome)
and \code{Y1} (outcome under treatment).}
}
\description{
Simulates a regression problem (Friedman #1) and defines a treatment effect.
Uses \code{mlbench.friedman1} to generate \code{X} features and a baseline outcome \code{Y0}.
The treatment potential outcome \code{Y1} is defined as \code{Y1 = Y0 + log(Y0 + 1)},
introducing a heterogeneous treatment effect.
}
\details{
The \code{mlbench.friedman1} function from the \pkg{mlbench} package is used
to generate 10 independent continuous features and a baseline outcome \code{Y0} with additive noise.
The treatment outcome \code{Y1} is defined by adding a non-linear term \code{log(Y0 + 1)}
to the baseline. If a seed is specified, the random number generator state is
reset at the start of the function (which affects other random operations).
