\title{Generate treatment indicator \code{Tr} ~ Bernoulli(pi)}
\usage{
gen_T(X, S, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame of covariates.}

\item{S}{A data frame with column \code{S} (0/1 indicating sample inclusion for each observation).}

\item{seed}{Optional numeric seed for RNG. If provided, \code{set.seed(seed - 1)} is used. Default \code{NULL} means no explicit seeding.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{Tr}{A data frame with a single column \code{Tr} (treatment assignments 0/1 for each observation).}
\item{pi}{A numeric vector of length equal to number of observations, giving the treatment probability used for each observation.}
}
\description{
Assigns a treatment indicator for each observation, combining an experimental design for included samples (S==1)
and an observational assignment for excluded samples (S==0).
}
\details{
For observations with \code{S==1} (in sample), treatment is assigned with probability \code{0.5} (mimicking a randomized experiment).
For those with \code{S==0} (out of sample), treatment probability is \eqn{\mathrm{plogis}(X0)}, i.e., it increases with the value of covariate \code{X0}.
The overall assignment probability for each observation is \eqn{\pi_i = S_i * 0.5 + (1 - S_i) * \mathrm{plogis}(X0_i)}.
If a seed is provided, an offset \code{seed - 1} is used to differentiate from other generation steps.
