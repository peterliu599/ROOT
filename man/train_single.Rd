\title{Train treatment propensity model for single sample mode}
\usage{
train_single(training_data, outcome, treatment)
}
\arguments{
\item{training_data}{A \code{data.frame} containing the outcome, treatment, and covariates.
Only \code{treatment} and covariates are used for fitting.}

\item{outcome}{A \code{character(1)} name of the outcome column. Present for a consistent signature and not used here.}

\item{treatment}{A \code{character(1)} name of the binary treatment indicator column with values \code{0} or \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with:
\item{e_m}{A \code{glm} model with binomial family for the treatment propensity.}
}
\description{
Fits a logistic regression model for \eqn{P(T = 1 \mid X)} on the provided training data.
Used by the single sample Double ML path where no sample selection model is required.
