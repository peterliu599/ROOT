\title{Reduce a feature selection weight by one half and renormalize}
\usage{
reduce_weight(fj, split_feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{fj}{A \code{character(1)} feature name that must be present in \code{names(split_feature)}.}

\item{split_feature}{A named \code{numeric} vector of probabilities for features as used in splitting.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} vector of the same length as \code{split_feature} that sums to \code{1}.
}
\description{
Lowers the probability weight of a given feature by one half and then renormalizes the full vector to sum to one.
}
\details{
This is used when a feature split was rejected. The feature probability is halved to reduce the chance of immediate reselection which encourages exploration of other features. If \code{fj} equals \code{"leaf"} its weight is also halved.
