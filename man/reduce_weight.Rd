\title{Reduce a feature's selection weight by half and renormalize}
\usage{
reduce_weight(fj, split_feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{fj}{A feature name (character string) present in the names of \code{split_feature}.}

\item{split_feature}{A named numeric vector of probabilities for features (as used in splitting).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{split_feature}, giving the updated probabilities that sum to 1.
}
\description{
Lowers the probability weight of a given feature by 50\%, and then re-normalizes the entire probability vector.
}
\details{
This is typically used when a particular feature split was rejected; the feature's probability is halved to reduce its chance of being chosen again immediately, encouraging exploration of other features. If \code{fj} is "leaf", its weight is also halved similarly.
