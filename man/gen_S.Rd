\title{Generate sample indicator \code{S} ~ Bernoulli(plogis(a))}
\usage{
gen_S(X, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame of covariates (must contain at least columns \code{X0} and \code{X1}).}

\item{seed}{Optional numeric seed for RNG. If provided, \code{set.seed(seed + 1)}
is invoked for reproducibility. If \code{NULL} (default), no specific seed is set.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a single column \code{S} of 0/1 values indicating inclusion (1) or exclusion (0).
}
\description{
Generates a binary sample inclusion indicator \code{S} for each observation,
using a logistic model influenced by a rectangular region in the first two covariates (\code{X0} and \code{X1}).
}
\details{
The inclusion probability is defined as \eqn{p = \mathrm{plogis}(a)},
where \eqn{a = 0.25 - 2 * I\{X0, X1 \text{ in region } (0.5,1)\}}.
In other words, observations for which both \code{X0} and \code{X1} lie in (0.5, 1)
have a lower odds of being included (due to a negative contribution in the linear predictor).
This mirrors a scenario where a specific region in feature space is under-sampled.
If a seed is set, it uses \code{seed + 1} to differentiate from other generators.
