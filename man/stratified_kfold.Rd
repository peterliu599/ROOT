\title{Stratified K fold index generator}
\usage{
stratified_kfold(S, K = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{A \code{vector} or \code{factor} indicating class membership for stratification. Typical values are \code{0} or \code{1}.}

\item{K}{An \code{integer(1)} number of folds. If \code{K} exceeds the number of observations it is reduced to that number.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of length \code{K} where each element is an \code{integer} vector of row indices assigned to that fold.
The union of all folds equals \code{seq_along(S)} and folds are close in size.
}
\description{
Splits indices into \code{K} folds while preserving the class distribution of a binary factor.
This mimics the behavior of stratified K fold allocation to keep the ratio of classes in each fold.
