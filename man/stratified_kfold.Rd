\title{Stratified K-fold index generator}
\usage{
stratified_kfold(S, K = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{A vector or factor indicating class membership (typically 0/1 or two-class factor) for stratification.}

\item{K}{Integer number of folds (K >= 2). If K is larger than the number of observations, it will be reduced to that number.}
}
\value{
A list of length K, where each element is an integer vector of row indices assigned to that fold.
The union of all folds equals \code{1:length(S)}, and folds are roughly equal in size.
}
\description{
Splits indices into K folds while preserving the class distribution of a binary factor.
This mimics scikit-learn's \code{StratifiedKFold}, ensuring each fold has a representative ratio of the two classes in \code{S}.
}
\details{
The function deterministically allocates indices to folds by class. For each class in \code{S}, indices are cyclically assigned to folds to balance counts.
If \code{K == 1}, a single fold containing all indices is returned (though typically K should be >= 2 for cross-validation).
