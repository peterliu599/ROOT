\title{Plot Under represented Population Characterization}
\usage{
\method{plot}{characterizing_underrep}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{characterizing_underrep} S3 object with \code{x$root$f} present as an
\code{rpart} object for the summary or characterization tree. The \code{rpart} model
should have classification levels that allow identification of the represented class.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{rpart.plot::prp()}.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}. The plot is drawn to the active graphics device.
}
\description{
Visualizes the decision tree derived from the \code{ROOT} analysis. Highlights
which subgroups are represented where \code{w = 1} versus underrepresented where \code{w = 0}.
}
\section{Abbreviations}{

ATE means Average Treatment Effect. RCT means Randomized Controlled Trial.
