\title{Print a characterizing_underrep fit}
\usage{
\method{print}{characterizing_underrep}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{characterizing_underrep} S3 object. Expected components include
\code{root} which is a \code{ROOT} object. The \code{ROOT} object may contain
\code{D_forest} which is data frame like, \code{D_rash} which may include \code{w_opt},
and \code{rashomon_set} which is an \code{integer} vector of selected tree indices.}

\item{...}{Currently unused. Included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{x} returned invisibly. Printed output is a human readable summary.
}
\description{
Prints the \code{ROOT} summary which includes unweighted and weighted estimates
with standard errors. The weighted SE is omitted when a custom \code{global_objective_fn}
was used in \code{ROOT()}. Provides a shorter overview of results.
}
\details{
Delegates core statistics, number of trees grown and Rashomon size,
and the percentage of observations with ensemble vote \code{w_opt == 1} to
\code{print(x$root)}.
}
\section{Abbreviations}{

ATE means Average Treatment Effect. RCT means Randomized Controlled Trial.
SE means Standard Error. TATE means Transported ATE. WTATE means Weighted TATE.
WATE means Weighted ATE. PATE means Population ATE.
