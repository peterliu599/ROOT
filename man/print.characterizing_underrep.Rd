\title{Print a characterizing_underrep fit}
\usage{
\method{print}{characterizing_underrep}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{characterizing_underrep} S3 object. Expected components include
\code{root} which is a \code{ROOT} object (summarized by \code{print.ROOT()})
and may contain \code{f} which is an \code{rpart} object for the summary tree,
and \code{leaf_summary} which is a \code{data.frame} with one row per terminal
node and may include a \code{rule} column of type \code{character}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused. Included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{object} returned invisibly. Printed output is a human readable brief summary.
}
\description{
Print the \code{ROOT} summary which includes unweighted and (when in
generalization mode) weighted estimates with standard errors, as reported by
\code{summary.ROOT()}.
}
\details{
Delegates core statistics and estimands to \code{print(x$root)}.
}
