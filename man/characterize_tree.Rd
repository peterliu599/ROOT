\title{Fit a shallow decision tree to characterize learned weights \code{w}}
\usage{
characterize_tree(X, w, max_depth = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A \code{data.frame} of covariates.}

\item{w}{A \code{vector} of length \code{nrow(X)} that is binary. Accepts \code{0} and \code{1} or a \code{factor} with two levels.}

\item{max_depth}{An \code{integer(1)} giving the maximum tree depth. Default is \code{3}.}
}
\value{
An \code{rpart} object that represents the fitted classification tree.
}
\description{
Trains a classification tree on the covariates \code{X} to predict the binary membership \code{w}.
This provides an interpretable summary of how the weighted subgroup can be distinguished by \code{X}.
}
\details{
The tree uses the Gini index for classification and no pruning with complexity parameter \code{cp = 0}. Depth control is through \code{max_depth}. If \code{w} is not a factor it is converted internally. The resulting rules indicate which covariates and splits separate the two classes defined by \code{w}.
