\title{Fit a shallow decision tree to characterize learned weights \code{w}}
\usage{
characterize_tree(X, w, max_depth = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame of covariates (features).}

\item{w}{A binary vector (0/1 or a factor with two levels) indicating class membership for each observation (e.g., whether an observation is in the selected subgroup).}

\item{max_depth}{Integer, the maximum tree depth (default 3).}
}
\value{
An \code{rpart} object representing the fitted decision tree.
}
\description{
Trains a classification tree on the covariates \code{X} to predict the binary membership \code{w}.
This provides an interpretable summary of how the weighted subgroup can be distinguished by \code{X}.
}
\details{
The tree is grown using the Gini index (classification) and is not pruned (complexity parameter \code{cp = 0}), relying solely on \code{max_depth} to control complexity. This mirrors the default behavior of scikit-learn's \code{DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=...)}.
If \code{w} is not already a factor, it will be converted internally. The tree's rules can be interpreted to understand which covariates (and what splits) best separate the two classes defined by \code{w}.
