\usage{
\method{print}{ROOT}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ROOT} S3 object returned by \code{ROOT()}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused and included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{x} returned invisibly. Printed output is a human readable summary.
}
\description{
Prints a \code{ROOT} object by reporting the primary estimands and core
diagnostics. The first lines report:
\enumerate{
\item the unweighted estimate which is ATE in an RCT for single sample or
TATE for two sample and its SE
\item the weighted estimate which is WATE in RCT or WTATE using \code{w_opt}
and its SE whenever \code{w_opt} is effectively binary which means subset mean SE.
If \code{w_opt} is nonbinary, the SE is omitted with a note.
}
Subsequent lines include number of trees grown, Rashomon size, and the
percentage of observations with ensemble vote \code{w_opt == 1}.
}
\details{
When \code{x$estimate} is absent, calculations mirror those described in
\code{\link{summary.ROOT}}.
}
\section{Abbreviations}{

ATE means Average Treatment Effect. RCT means Randomized Controlled Trial.
SE means Standard Error. TATE means Transported ATE. WTATE means Weighted TATE.
