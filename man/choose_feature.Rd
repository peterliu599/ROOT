\title{Randomly choose a split feature based on provided probabilities}
\usage{
choose_feature(split_feature, depth)
}
\arguments{
\item{split_feature}{A named numeric vector of feature selection probabilities. Names should correspond to feature IDs (and may include a special "leaf" entry).}

\item{depth}{Current tree depth (an integer, used for parity with Python implementation but not affecting probabilities in this implementation).}
}
\value{
A single feature name (or "leaf") chosen randomly according to the provided probability weights.
}
\description{
Given a probability distribution over features (and possibly a "leaf" option), selects one feature at random according to those probabilities.
}
\note{
The factor \eqn{2^{(0 * depth / 4)}} present in the code is effectively 1 (no effect on the first element's weight) and is included only for parity with an equivalent Python implementation. All probabilities are normalized to sum to 1 before sampling.
