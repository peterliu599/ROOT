\title{Randomly choose a split feature based on provided probabilities}
\usage{
choose_feature(split_feature, depth)
}
\arguments{
\item{split_feature}{A named \code{numeric} vector of feature selection probabilities. Names correspond to feature identifiers and may include \code{"leaf"}.}

\item{depth}{An \code{integer(1)} giving the current tree depth. Present for parity with the Python version and does not change probabilities here.}
}
\value{
A \code{character(1)} which is the chosen feature name or \code{"leaf"}.
}
\description{
Selects one feature name at random according to a probability vector that may include a special \code{"leaf"} entry.
}
\note{
The factor \eqn{2^{(0 \cdot \mathrm{depth} / 4)}} present in the code equals \code{1} and does not change the first element weight. All probabilities are normalized to sum to \code{1} before sampling.
