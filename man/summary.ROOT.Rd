\title{Summarize a ROOT fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{ROOT}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{ROOT} object returned by \code{ROOT()}.}

\item{...}{Unused; included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
The input \code{object}, invisibly. Printed output is a human-readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes a \code{ROOT} object by reporting the primary estimands and key
model diagnostics. The first lines report:
\enumerate{
\item the \strong{unweighted} estimate (ATE in RCT for single-sample or TATE for two-sample)
and its \strong{standard error (SE)};
\item the \strong{weighted} estimate (Weighted ATE in RCT or WTATE using \code{w_opt}) and its
\strong{SE} \emph{when the default objective is used}; if a custom
\code{global_objective_fn} was supplied in \code{ROOT()}, the weighted SE is omitted.
}
Subsequent lines describe the estimand type, number of trees, size of the Rashomon set,
presence of a summary tree, covariate count, observation count, baseline loss,
selected-tree losses, and the proportion kept by \code{w_opt}.
}
\details{
This method prefers pre-computed estimates in \code{object$estimate} (as stored by \code{ROOT()}).
If unavailable, it recomputes:
\itemize{
\item Unweighted effect as \eqn{\bar v}{mean(v)} over the analysis set
(all rows in single-sample; \code{S == 1} in two-sample);
\item Unweighted SE as \eqn{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - \bar v)^2}}{sqrt(var(v)/n)}
on the same set;
\item Weighted effect as \eqn{\frac{\sum_i w_i v_i}{\sum_i w_i}}{sum(w*v)/sum(w)},
where \code{w = w\_opt} (binary);
\item Weighted SE as \eqn{\frac{\sqrt{\sum_i w_i (v_i - \bar v_w)^2}}{\sum_i w_i}}{sqrt(sum(w*(v-mu_w)^2))/sum(w)},
printed only when the default objective was used.
