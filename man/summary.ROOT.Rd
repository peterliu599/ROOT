\title{Summarize a ROOT fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{ROOT}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{ROOT} S3 object returned by \code{ROOT()}.
Expected components include \code{D_forest} which is data frame like with
columns \code{v}, \code{vsq}, \code{S}, \code{lX}, and \code{w_tree_*},
\code{D_rash} which may contain \code{w_opt}, \code{rashomon_set}
which is \code{integer()}, optional \code{estimate} which is a \code{list} with fields
\code{estimand_unweighted}, \code{value_unweighted}, \code{se_unweighted},
\code{estimand_weighted}, \code{value_weighted}, \code{se_weighted},
\code{se_weighted_note}, and optional \code{f} which is an \code{rpart} object.}

\item{...}{Currently unused and included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{object} returned invisibly. Printed output is a human readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes a \code{ROOT} object by reporting the primary estimands and key
model diagnostics. The first lines report:
\enumerate{
\item the unweighted estimate which is ATE in an RCT for single sample
or TATE for two sample and its standard error \emph{SE}
\item the weighted estimate which is WATE in RCT or WTATE using \code{w_opt}
and its SE whenever \code{w_opt} is effectively binary which means subset mean SE.
If \code{w_opt} is nonbinary, the SE is omitted with a note.
}
Subsequent lines describe the estimand type, number of trees, size of the
Rashomon set, presence of a summary tree, covariate count, observation count,
baseline loss, selected tree losses, and the proportion kept by \code{w_opt}.
}
\details{
This method prefers precomputed estimates in \code{object$estimate}. If
unavailable, it recomputes:
\itemize{
\item Unweighted effect as \eqn{\bar v}{mean(v)} over the analysis set
where the analysis set is all rows in single sample and \code{S == 1} in two sample
\item Unweighted SE as \eqn{\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum (v_i - \bar v)^2 }}
which is \code{sqrt( sum((v - vbar)^2) / ( n * (n - 1) ) )}
\item Weighted effect when \code{w_opt} is binary with
\eqn{A = \{ i : w_i = 1 \}} which is \code{A <- which(w == 1)}, that is
\eqn{\bar v_A = \frac{1}{n_A}\sum_{i \in A} v_i}
which is \code{mean(v[w == 1])}
\item Weighted SE which is WTATE or WATE for binary \code{w_opt} as
\eqn{\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_A(n_A-1)} \sum_{i \in A} (v_i - \bar v_A)^2 }}
which is \code{sqrt( sum( (v[w == 1] - vbarA)^2 ) / ( nA * (nA - 1) ) )}
}
