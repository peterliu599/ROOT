\title{Summarize a ROOT fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{ROOT}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{ROOT} object returned by \code{ROOT()}.}

\item{...}{Unused; included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
The input \code{object}, invisibly. Printed output is a human-readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes a \code{ROOT} object by reporting the primary estimands and key
model diagnostics. The first two lines report:
\enumerate{
\item the \strong{unweighted} estimate (ATE in RCT for single-sample or TATE for two-sample)
and its \strong{standard error (SE)};
\item the \strong{weighted} estimate (Weighted ATE in RCT or WTATE, using the learned subgroup
weights \code{w_opt}) and its \strong{SE}.
}
Subsequent lines describe the estimand type, number of trees, size of the Rashomon set,
presence of a summary tree, covariate count, observation count, baseline loss,
selected-tree losses, and the proportion kept by \code{w_opt}.
}
\details{
This method prefers pre-computed estimates under \code{object$estimate} (as stored by \code{ROOT()}).
If unavailable, it recomputes:
\itemize{
\item Unweighted mean as \eqn{\mathrm{mean}(v)} over the analysis set
(all rows in single-sample; \code{S==1} in two-sample);
\item Unweighted SE as \eqn{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}(v)/(n)}} on the same set;
\item Weighted mean as \eqn{\sum w v / \sum w} where \code{w = w_opt} (binary),
and weighted SE as \eqn{\sqrt{\sum w (v - \bar v_w)^2}/\sum w}.
}
