\title{Summarize a characterizing_underrep fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{characterizing_underrep}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{characterizing_underrep} S3 object. Expected components include
\code{root} which is a \code{ROOT} object and may contain \code{f} which is an
\code{rpart} object for the summary tree, and \code{leaf_summary} which is a
\code{data.frame} with one row per terminal node and may include a \code{rule}
column of type \code{character}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused. Included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{object} returned invisibly. Printed output is a human readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes the \code{ROOT} summary which includes unweighted and weighted estimates
with standard errors. The weighted SE is omitted when a custom \code{global_objective_fn}
was used in \code{ROOT()}. Provides a brief overview of terminal rules from the
annotated summary tree when available.
}
\details{
Delegates core statistics to \code{summary(object$root)}. Previews up to
ten terminal rules when a summary tree exists and reports plot availability.
