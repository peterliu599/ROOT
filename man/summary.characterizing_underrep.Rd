\title{Summarize a characterizing_underrep fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{characterizing_underrep}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{characterizing_underrep} S3 object. Expected components include
\code{root} which is a \code{ROOT} object (summarized by \code{summary.ROOT()})
and may contain \code{f} which is an \code{rpart} object for the summary tree,
and \code{leaf_summary} which is a \code{data.frame} with one row per terminal
node and may include a \code{rule} column of type \code{character}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused. Included for S3 compatibility.}
}
\value{
\code{object} returned invisibly. Printed output is a readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes the \code{ROOT} summary which includes unweighted and (when in
generalization mode) weighted estimates with standard errors, as reported by
\code{summary.ROOT()}. Provides a brief overview of terminal rules from the
annotated summary tree when available.
}
\details{
Delegates core statistics and estimands to \code{summary(object$root)}.
Previews up to ten terminal rules when a summary tree exists.
