Description: Implements a general framework for globally optimizing 
  user-specified objective functionals over interpretable binary weight functions 
  represented as sparse decision trees, called ROOT (Rashomon Set of Optimal Trees). 
  It searches over candidate trees to construct a 
  Rashomon set of near-optimal solutions and derives a summary tree highlighting stable 
  patterns in the optimized weights. ROOT includes a built-in generalizability mode for 
  identifying subgroups in trial settings for transportability analyses 
  (Parikh et al. (2025) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2025.2495319>).
